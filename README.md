# GroupTheory [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/donald-pinckney/GroupTheory.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/donald-pinckney/GroupTheory)
Consider this a playground for implementing fun group theory operations.

## Currently Implemented Functionality
- Groups
  - Template based, so you can create groups of arbitrary type and laws of composition
- Subgroups
  - Verify if something is a subgroup
  - Find all subgroups of a group
  - Check if a subgroup is normal
- Cosets
  - Compute left cosets of a subgroup
  - Compute right cosets of a subgroup
- Common Groups
  - Includes functions to create the Symmetric group and Dihedral group.

## Examples
See [example.cpp](https://github.com/donald-pinckney/GroupTheory/blob/master/example.cpp) for some examples.

## Building the Examples
Building should be as easy as running the `make` command, assuming your machine has GNU Make and g++ installed.
